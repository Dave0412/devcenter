As part of our efforts to introduce a credit-based model, we’re now offering our new Teams plan. You can sign up for a free trial, or subscribe to the full plan. Here’s everything you need to know about it!

## If I sign up for a trial, when will it end?

As of now, Teams plan trials are indefinite, there’s no time limit on using it. You can use the Teams plan trial as long as you have credits.

## Can I sign up for the full Teams plan?

Yes, if you are the **owner** of a Teams account. To do so:

1. Go to the [**Profile settings**](https://app.bitrise.io/me/profile#/overview) page.
2. Click **Switch profile.**
3. Select the Teams account. This will take you to the overview page where you can see your available credits.
4. Click the **Subscribe to the Teams plan** button.
5. Choose your credit tier.
6. Click **Checkout**.

After that, you'll need to provide payment details. Once the first payment is authorized, your subscription starts immediately.

## What features does the Teams plan have?

The benefits of the Teams plan include:

* Unlimited private apps.
* Unlimited team members and all the team management features.
* Multiple machines types to choose from.
* Add-ons, such as Test Reports and Ship.

## How do I get credits?

You get 500 credits for the trial. Once you run out, your trial ends.

On the full Teams plan, you get a certain amount of credits each month, depending on your credit tier. If you need more credits, you need to upgrade to a higher credit tier. To do so:

1. Go to the [**Profile settings**](https://app.bitrise.io/me/profile#/overview) page.
2. Click **Switch profile.**
3. Select the Teams account. This will take you to the overview page where you can see your available credits.
4. Click the **Change credit tier** button.
5. Choose the new credit tier.
6. Click **Checkout**.

After that, you'll need to provide payment details. Once the first payment is authorized, your new subscription starts immediately. If you had some unused credits from the previous subscription, don't worry: these roll over and you can use them in the first month of the new subscription!

## How do I use my credits?

Just trigger a build! Each build will use a certain amount of credits per minute, depending on the [type of stack](/jp/team-management/teams-plan-faq/#do-the-different-machine-types-have-different-credit-costs) you use.

## Will a build be aborted if I run out of credits?

No, running builds will never be aborted. You can always finish a running build.

## How many apps can I have?

On the Teams plan trial, you can have as many apps as you want.

## How much build time do I have?

You have a limit of 90 minutes for each build.
