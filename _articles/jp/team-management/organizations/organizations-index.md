The purpose of Workspaces is to make it easier to manage several people working on different apps on Bitrise. [Workspaces can own an unlimited number of apps](/jp/team-management/organizations/managing-apps/), and Workspace owners can assign Workspace members to work on different apps as they see fit.

Workspaces consist of groups: Workspace owners [can create groups and decide which members belong to which groups](/jp/team-management/organizations/members-organizations/). A given group can be assigned to work on an app: all members of the same group will have the same level of access to the app.

Workspaces can take advantage of [SAML Single Sign-On](/jp/team-management/organizations/saml-sso-in-organizations/): we have guides for setting it up with several major identity providers.
