Set up an email address so we can send you your invoices - no need to rummage around the site looking for them, we'll deliver them straight to your inbox. However, if you wish to download it manually from the site, you can do that, too, of course! You can find the past invoices on the Workspace's **Billing** page - you can read more [here](#downloading-workspace-invoices)!

### Setting up an email address for Workspace invoices

By default, a Workspace's invoices will be sent to the email provided when the Workspace was created. However, the owner(s) of the Workspace can change it at any time.

1. Sign in with an account that is a member of the Workspace.
1. In the top right corner, open the account selector dropdown menu. 
1. Find the Workspace you need and click the little gear icon next to its name.
3. On the left, select **Billing** from the menu options.
