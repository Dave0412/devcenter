Set up an email address so we can send you your invoices - no need to rummage around the site looking for them, we'll deliver them straight to your inbox. However, if you wish to download it manually from the site, you can do that, too, of course! You can find the past invoices on the Workspace's **Billing** page - you can read more [here](#downloading-workspace-invoices)!

### Setting up an email address for Workspace invoices

By default, a Workspace's invoices will be sent to the email provided when the Workspace was created. However, the owner(s) of the Workspace can change it at any time.

1. Sign in with an account that is an owner of a Workspace and open its profile page.
2. Go to your Workspace's profile page: click **Switch Profile** on the top left corner and select the Workspace you need.

   Be aware that your own billing info and your Workspace's billing info are SEPARATE. You CANNOT change your Workspace's information in the settings of your own personal profile.
3. On the left, select **Billing** from the menu options.
