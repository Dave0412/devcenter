It's very simple to set up a subscription plan for your Workspace even if you skipped that step when creating the Workspace. You can also modify your plan and your billing information at any time if you are the owner of the Workspace.

You can set up a credit card and we'll bill you automatically; for other payment methods, please contact our support.

### Adding or modifying billing info

1. Sign in with an account that is a member of the Workspace.
2. In the top right corner, open the account selector dropdown menu.
3. Find the Workspace you need and click the little gear icon next to its name.
4. On the left, select **Billing** from the menu options.

5. If you didn't provide your billing information, do so: click **Add credit card** on the right of the **Billing information** menu.

   If you do not want to be billed automatically, you do not need to provide a credit card. In this case, contact our support to set up a different payment method, such as wire transfer. This option is available from 6x concurrency on Standard plans or 3x concurrency on Elite plans but only with ANNUAL BILLING.
6. Fill out the details.

   Note that only the owner(s) of the Workspace's has any access to the Workspace's billing information.
