If you have a small hobby project that needs a Continous Integration service, Bitrise's free Hobby plan is your best bet. Here’s everything you need to know about the credit-based Hobby plan!

## How do I  sign up for the free plan?

After [signing up for Bitrise](/getting-started/signing-up-to-bitrise/), create [a new Workspace](/team-management/organizations/creating-org). If it's your first Workspace, you will be automatically granted a [free trial on the Teams plan](/team-management/teams-plan-faq/). Once the trial is over, the Workspace will be placed on the Hobby plan.

## How do I get credits?

You get a certain amount of credits each month: this is what we call your monthly credit bundle.

## How do I use my credits?

Just trigger a build! Each build will use a certain amount of credits per minute, depending on the type of stack you use.

## Do unused credits roll over to future months?

The credits do not roll over month-to-month. You will start every monthly cycle with the same amount of credits.

## What happens if I run out of credits?

Build with confidence: a running build will never be aborted. When you’re about to run out of credits, we’ll send you notifications to warn you. Once you run out, you won’t be able to add new apps or run builds until you receive your next monthly credit bundle.

## Will a build be aborted if I run out of credits?

No, running builds will never be aborted. You can always finish a running build.

## How many apps can I have?

On the credit-based Hobby plan, you can have one private app and up to ten public apps.

## How much build time do I have?

You have a limit of 90 minutes for each build.

## Do the different stacks have different credit costs?

Yes. Builds cost 2 credits per minute on our macOS-based stacks and 1 credit per minute on our Linux-based stacks.

## How many builds can I run at the same time?

You can run 10 builds on macOS stacks and 80 builds on Linux stacks in parallel.
