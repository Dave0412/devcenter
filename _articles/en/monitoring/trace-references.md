## Trace data collection

In order for Trace to provide information on the performance of your apps, our SDK collects data about the app when running on the end users device. We collect data related to session properties, as well as metrics and traces.

## Session properties

* Device Type: The name of the device type (for example, iPhone X).
* App Version: The version name.
* App Build: The app version code or build number.
* Network: The network type the device is connected to (for example, 4G, wifi, EDGE).
* Carrier: The network or cell phone carrier (for example, AT&T, T-Mobile, Vodafone).
* OS Version: The operating system version.

## Metrics and traces

* Application CPU usage: the percentage of device CPU used by the target app.
* App Memory usage: the percentage of device memory used by the target app.
* Startup trace:
  * The time elapsed from app startup to full readiness.
  * The relevant timestamps.
* Crash traces:
  * Exception.
  * Crash report.
  * The relevant timestamps.
* Network traces:
  * URL (query and fragement parameters are stripped).
  * Request size (in bytes).
  * Response size (in bytes).
  * Status code.
  * Duration of entire request/response.
  * The relevant timestamps.
* View traces:
  * view name
  * duration of time displayed
  * The relevant timestamps.
